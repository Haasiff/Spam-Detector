# Spam-Detector

A spam detector is a software or algorithm designed to identify and filter out unsolicited or irrelevant messages, typically found in emails, comments, messages, or other digital communication channels. Its primary function is to distinguish legitimate content from unwanted or potentially harmful content, such as spam, phishing attempts, or malicious messages. Spam detectors use various techniques, including keyword analysis, content filtering, sender reputation analysis, machine learning, and heuristics to identify and block or quarantine spam messages. They help users and organizations maintain the quality and security of their communication channels by reducing the clutter and potential risks associated with unwanted or fraudulent content.
